-> FT_PRINTF
Contains a printf function that manages precision and width with "d, x, s" conversions this version of the printf was written in order to pass the exam as quickly as possible!

-> UNION
contains a program that takes two strings and displays, without doubles, the
characters that appear in either one of the strings. The display will be in the order characters appear in the command line, and will be followed by a \n. If the number of arguments is not 2, the program displays \n.

-> INTER
Contains a program that takes two strings and displays, without doubles, the characters that appear in both strings, in the order they appear in the first one. The display will be followed by a \n. If the number of arguments is not 2, the program displays \n.
